Introduction

In this lab we will ensure that Git is installed on your
system and be able to get famliar with the user interface.


Lab Goals:

1. Install Hadoop in Windows, Mac or Linux.
2. Start the basic git command line.

== STEP 1)  Install Git.

    Open the following link in your browser
    
    http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
    
    Follow the instructions for your operating system
    
== STEP 2) Specifically for Windows

    Since most Linux or Mac developers are usually used to working on the command line, this steps concentrates on Git for Windows
    
    Open this link: http://git-scm.com/download/win
    
    And install the executable that will be downloaded on your computer    
    TAKE ALL THE DEFAULTS. This will assure that every student has the same install configuration. 
    After you are done with the labs, you will be able to experiment with various install options.
    
== STEP 3) Open git command line in a directory

    If you are in Windows, prepare a new 'git-labs' directory in the File browser, 
    then right-click on that directory and choose "Git-Bash" menu. 
    This will open git command line.
    
    If you are on Mac or Linux, just open a terminal in the newly-created 'git-labs' directory
    Git command will be available, since you have installed it in step 1
    
== STEP 4) Experiment with git command

    Type 
    git
    and hit the ENTER key
    
    Observe git help
    
    Type
    
    git status
    
    You should get 'Not a git repository'
    
    Type
    
    pwd
    
    Note that you will see the working directory.
    
    Deduce from here that you are in a fully implemented Linux environment. Indeed, this is a cygwin implemenation. Experiment with linux commands, such as 'ls'
