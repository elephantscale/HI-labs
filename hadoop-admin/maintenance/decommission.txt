How do we decommission a node gracefully
(to upgrade the machine, to update software ..etc)

== STEP 1)
    Find the file that is pointed by 'dfs.exclude.hosts' property
usually   /etc/hadoop/conf/dfs.excludes


== STEP 2)
    Add en entry for the host in that file (one line per host)
    e.g.
        dn12.hadoop1.mycompany.com

== STEP 3) refresh configuration
    $ hdfs dfsadmin  -refreshNodes


== STEP 4)
    check web UI to make sure the host is decommissioned
    also can use command line
        $ hdfs dfsadmin -report

== STEP 5)
    shutdown the machine and do any needed maitantance


== STEP 6)
    bring the machien back up

== STEP 7)
    remove the machine entry from 'dfs.exclude.hosts' file

== STEP 8)
    refreshNodes

== STEP 9)
    check to make the node has joined the cluster
    UI & dfsadmin -report
